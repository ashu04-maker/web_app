    <h2>Chennai</h2>
    <h4>Beach,Art & Culture-Food & Drink</h4>
    <p>The capital city of Tamil Nadu, Chennai is well known for its cultural and historic sites. Earlier known as Madras, 
        the city is the economic hub of the country. The city features many Hindu temples, churches, and great museums. 
        Chennai has everything from its white-sand beaches to mouth-watering seafood. Major attractions include Marina Beach, 
        Government Museum Chennai, and Santhome Cathedral Basilica among others.
    </p>
    <h4>Places to visit in Chennai</h4>
    <h4>1.Fort St. George</h4>
    <img src="/poject media/Fort St George.jpg" alt="image of fort st george">
    <p>Fort St. George (or historically, White Town)is a fortress at the coastal city of Chennai, India. Founded in 1639, it was 
        the first English (later British) fortress in India.The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements 
        and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city 
        (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress.The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other 
        official buildings.
    </p>
    <h4>2.Marina Beach</h4>
    <img src="/poject media/Marina Beach.jpg" alt="image of marina beach">
    <p>Marina Beach, or simply the Marina, is a natural urban beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal. 
        The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, a distance of 6.0 km (3.7 mi),
        making it the second longest urban beach in the world, after Cox's Bazar Beach.It is a prominent landmark in Chennai.
        The Marina is a primarily sandy beach, with an average width of 300 m (980 ft)and the width at the widest stretch is 
        437 m (1,434 ft). Bathing and swimming at the Marina are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent 
        is very turbulent. It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country and attracts about 30,000 visitors a day during 
        weekdays and  50,000 visitors a day during the weekends and on holidays.During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 people 
        visit the beach daily.

    <h4>3.San Thome Church</h4>
    <img src="/poject media/san thome church.jpg" alt="image of san thome church">
    <p>San Thome Church, officially known as St Thomas Cathedral Basilica and National Shrine of Saint Thomas, is a minor basilica 
        of the Catholic Church in India, at the Santhome neighbourhood of Chennai, in Tamil Nadu. The present structure dates to 1523 
        AD, when it was rebuilt by the Portuguese over the tomb of Thomas the Apostle.[3] In 1896, it was renovated in the Madras 
        province according to neo-Gothic designs, as was favoured by British architects in the late 19th century. In antiquity, 
        there was a basilica built over the tomb of the Apostle Philip in Hierapolis of Phrygia, present-day Pamukkale.

    <h4>4.Mamallapuram</h4>
    <img src="/poject media/Mamallapuram.jpg" alt="image of mamallapuram">
    <p>Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, 
        best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is one 
        of the famous tourist sites in India.The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai. It is a part of Chennai Metropolitan 
        Area. It is a satellite town of Chennai.
        Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king 
        Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of 
        royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in 
        the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore 
        Temple dedicated to Shiva.The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.
